# Hey there! I'm Carey:D

#### I am a third year Computer Science student at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/)

#### I am currently working as a Security Engineer Intern at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and as an Undergraduate Software Engineer at [SunSwift Racing](https://www.sunswift.com/) and do stuff with [UNSW Security Society](https://unswsecurity.com/) for fun!

#### I am keen on building software projects, lower-level infrastructure and learning something about everything. 

#### I value security the most and like doing CTFs for fun. 

#### I love music and enjoy playing fingerstyle.

#### I am an Fujifilm lover.
